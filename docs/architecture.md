- **Custom Pipeline:** Voice processing and optimization

**Architecture:**
- Service abstraction layer
- Fallback mechanisms
- Response caching
- Usage monitoring

## Data Flow Architecture

### 1. User Authentication Flow

```mermaid

    participant U as User
    participant F as Frontend
    participant A as Auth API
    participant S as Supabase
    
    U->>F: Login Request
    F->>A: POST /auth/login
    A->>S: Validate Credentials
    S-->>A: User Data + JWT
    A-->>F: Authentication Response
    F-->>U: Dashboard Access
```

### 2. Agent Creation Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant F as Frontend
    participant A as API
    participant D as Database
    participant AI as AI Services
    
    U->>F: Create Agent
    F->>A: POST /agents
    A->>D: Store Agent Config
    A->>AI: Initialize AI Model
    AI-->>A: Model Ready
    A-->>F: Agent Created
    F-->>U: Success Confirmation
```

### 3. Call Processing Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Customer
    participant V as Voice Gateway
    participant A as Agent
    participant AI as AI Services
    participant D as Database
    
    C->>V: Incoming Call
    V->>A: Route to Agent
    A->>AI: Process Speech
    AI-->>A: Intent + Response
    A->>D: Log Interaction
    A->>V: Generate Response
    V-->>C: Voice Response
```

## Security Architecture

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

**Multi-layered Security:**
- JWT tokens for API authentication

- Encrypted environment variables
- Secure key management

**Privacy:**
- GDPR compliance measures
- Data retention policies
- User consent management
- Audit logging

## Scalability Considerations

### 1. Horizontal Scaling

**Frontend:**
